New Heart Game Website
===================


NewMe is the result of a collaboration between New Heart Cardiac Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico and a group of students from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Our combined goal is to give patients coping with diabetes an entertaining and fun way to manage their illness effectively. Through this game, it is our hope that diabetics can become happier and healthier, and we hope that this game will become a model for others to follow. Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,
